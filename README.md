# Giftr
An app to give away the stuff you don't use or receive other people's stuff.
It's a simple catalog of gifts. Want it? Claim it. The "gifter" will then be able to see a list of people who claimed it, along with their message.

## Installation
* Clone this repository
* Install dependencies
* Run the app with python 2.7: `python views.py`
* It's running on http://localhost:8080

## Limitations
No functionality has been implemented yet to:
* locate users (although the User table is ready with an address row)
* accept/reject claims
* contact users
* notify users of claims

## Contributing
Ideas, contributions and improvements are more than welcome. When adding a feature, please create a separate topic branch and first look at the Issues to find out if it's there already.
